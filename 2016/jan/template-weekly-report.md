How to write a weekly report. 

Name convention:  Weekly update – your name – 2016-01-18

Please plan to send a brief, weekly, email update  regarding:

-	Progress on your IALSA-related project(s) in the past week  
-	Progress on other research over the past week that it is relevant for us to discuss  
-	Next steps: (a) what you will work on in the next week, (b) longer-term goals, as relevant  
-	Roadblocks/challenges  
-	Whether it would be helpful to meet – this can be for 60 seconds or 60 minutes, or anything in between. We might also decide that a particular issue warrants a group/lab discussion. In most cases I assume we will meet, but we may find that we can resolve some challenges quickly via email.   
-	Other items/info/queries
