## Papers
I begin composing a manuscript production pipeline. Ideally, I would distribute papers across the sequential stages to keep the pipeline nicely flowing. The following list represents the order in which I think I should priorities publication immediacy.

## Papers
1. CAR methods - I present a digital poster at CPA on June 9  
2. Wave inclusion - statistical methods paper, learn writing and publishing workflow, bookdown
3. Dissertation -> Interface for Big Analysis, thesis must be published. Joe visits on March 13. Give him something to read. 
4. EMOSA -> linking psychological modelling with clinical population data. Connect with VIHA.
