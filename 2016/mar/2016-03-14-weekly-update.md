Progress report

TECH SUPPORT 

A. [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)   
- .next steps. more time on the design of the dynamic table for model look up. [issue](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) the basics are sketched, but in current form its use is not practical.
- 1. progress.  met with W.Beasly and M.Shahid to advance the scribe/parser. [log](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues/30). We focused on the parser for the wave-inclusion (see [example](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/tree/master/sandbox/01-univariate-linear)).

C. [ialsa-study-curator](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-study-curator)   
- .next steps. MAP.  We don't have a record of how the data is obtained from the source. Such description should be added to the README. I created a separate [issue ](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP/issues/18) to track the discussion. 
-  1. progress. OBAS.  Met with R.Vendittelli [log](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/issues/4), together we worked on systematized the desdription of the OBAS files ([contents.md](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/blob/master/data-unshared/contents.md)) and learning relevant R syntax to advance in data preparation.  The next meeting is scheduled for 2016-03-14-10:00.    
-  2. progress. LASA. Met with R.Graham. [log](https://github.com/IALSA/LASA/issues/6). We worked through importing the raw data ([see script](https://github.com/IALSA/LASA/blob/master/scripts/users/r-graham/0-import-raw-graham.R)), now we are ready to start assembling the analysis ready dataset (using this [script](https://github.com/IALSA/LASA/blob/master/scripts/users/r-graham/1-compose-dataframes-graham.R) ). R.Graham will contact me when she is ready for another session.  

SCIENCE   
 
A. [ialsa-car-methods](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-car-methods)    
  
B. [wave-inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion)  
 - .next steps. creating an information display for univaraite linear models. We need to demonstrate the effect of the number of waves to include into the analysis on the conclusions draws from the statistical model. Attrition has a particular role to play in this explanation. Next meeting scheduled for Wednesday 2016-03-09 at 8:00 Pacific Time.
