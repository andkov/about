#### Next Steps on the Parser

with A.Piccinin, verify

1. how outcomes mapped to domains
2. Are these the domains we need/like?
 = which should be combined?
 = which should be broken down?

 PCP is the finalization of the talks the precede it. It is assumed that before PCP is maled out to the participants, eahc of them would be contacted via email to obtain the initial, unstructured information about the study (e.g. potential variables to include, temporal design, limitations, comments) 
 
 
 PCP is the last chance to specify
 -1. whether you have that variable
 -2. how it is spelled in the dataset
 
 After verifying the domain map structure, we can start testing PCS.
