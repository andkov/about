TECH SUPPORT 

A. [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)   
 - .progress. cleaned the repository ([log](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/118)) and modernized the reproduction workflow ([log](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/119)).
 - .next steps. need to spend more time testing the reproduction scripts to achieve convenient debugging options during extraction.
 - .next steps. more time on the design of the dynamic table for model look up. [issue](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) the basics are sketched, but in current form its use is not practical.

C. [ialsa-study-curator](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-study-curator)   
  - .next steps. We don't have a record of how the data is obtained from the source. Such description should be added to the README. I created a separate [issue ](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP/issues/18) to track the discussion. 
  - 1. progress. Met with R.Vendittelli to established basic import of OBAS data. see [log](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/issues/2) for details.
  - 2. next steps. R.Vendittelli was [tasked](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/issues/3) with providing description to the raw files. Once such description is provided in [GitHub/OBAS/data-unshared/contents.md](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/blob/master/data-unshared/contents.md) we can start combining the files. The next meeting is scheduled for 2016-03-07. 


SCIENCE   
 
A. [ialsa-car-methods](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-car-methods)    
  
B. [wave-inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion)  
 - .next steps. creating an information display for univeratite linear models. We need to demonstrate the effect of the number of waves to include into the analysis on the conclusions draws from the statistical model. Attrition has a particular role to play in this explanation. Next meeting scheduled for Wednesday 2016-03-09 at 8:00 Pacific Time. 

C. [portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive)   
- 1. progress. [updated](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/4) domain map. See current version [here](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/tree/master/manipulation).
