Progress report

TECH SUPPORT 

A. [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)   
- .next steps. more time on the design of the dynamic table for model look up. [issue](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) the basics are sketched, but in current form its use is not practical. 

B. [ialsa-2015-portland-stencil](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil)  
- next steps. verify the domain map (over which we met briefly with A.Piccinin on 2016-03-09) , so that the `.csv` could be sent out for people (Phillipe, Scott) to comment on and agree on the same structure.   
- next step. start testing REDCap survey.     

C. [ialsa-study-curator](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-study-curator)   
- .blocks. MAP.  We don't have a record of how the data is obtained from the source. Such description should be added to the README. I created a separate [issue ](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP/issues/18) to track the discussion. 
- 1. progress. OBAS. met with R.Vendittelli. [log](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/issues/5). Finalised the first script in data grooming sequence -  [`0-import-raw.r`](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/blob/master/scripts/data/0-import-raw.R) - which imports and merges the three files in the focus of the analytic agenda. 
- .next steps. OBAS. Develop the second script in the data grooming sequence: `1-apply-codebook`. See the [log: 2016-03-14](https://github.com/IALSA/OBAS/issues/5) for details.  

SCIENCE

B. [wave-inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion)  
  - next steps. We decided that we should start with demonstrating the issue of wave inclusion for the **univariate** case first, using only R to keep things in the same ecosystem. This will allow us to focus on the models and graphs themselves. Once a univariate case is demonstrated we can start thinking whether expansion to MPlus would be justified further advance the project, which does not have to end after the first publication. next meeting is scheduled for 2016-03-23-09:30 Pacific.
