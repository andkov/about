## [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)
**description**: A script development. Developing reporting tools for coordinated analysis with replication (CAR) workshop, conducted at Portland in Feb 2015.  
**progress**:  none 
**roadblocks**: waiting on the [ialsa-2015-portland-stencil](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil) to acquire enough shape. As stencil is developed futher we'll start cleaning the original repo. 
**next steps**: not clear yet

### [Portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive)

**description**:  A manuscript production. Focuses on the models from the [Portland CAR workshop](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)  in which **physical** and **cognitive** outcomes form a bivariate linear structure.   
**progress**:  During the last meeting on [Jan 5](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/3) @ampiccinin and @andkov examined names of the cognitive measures included into [physical-cognitive track](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive).  @ampiccinin [suggested](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/blob/master/analysis/model_space/docs/domain-mapping-piccinin.docx) a conceptualization of how colors can be used to map various cognitive measures into a continuum of discrete domains. The [cognitive domain map](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/blob/master/analysis/model_space/Cog-Domain-Map.md) is the implementation of this. It provides a quick sensus view of what cognitive measures are available and how they can be organized into meaningful clusters.        
**roadblocks**:  a clearer path for implementing manuscript production is needed.  
**next steps**: 1) Some tactical decisions are required: as the original taxonomy was revised, new domains crystallized `perception` and `verbal reasoning`. They need to be incorportated into the continuum to finalize the current state of the graph.   See [issue #4](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/4) in the [Portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive) repository.   2)  We need to decide what is the next information display is necessary to advance in the research agenda.
