1. I need to design a dynamic table to retrieve model estimation results. See issue [#117](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117). 

2. To think of it, I need to create a major revision of the available tools and keep only those that seem useful. Throw everything else into legacy.
