[Jan 3](https://github.com/andkov/about/blob/master/2016/log/jan/2016-01-03.md)  planning papers and projects

[Jan 5](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/3) met with Andrea Piccinin to conduct renaming of the cognitive measures in the Portland project. 

Jan 7 - Jan 16 : Vacation

[Jan 18]()   informal meeting with [Eli Puterman](http://profiles.ucsf.edu/eli.puterman) discussing his [projects on telomers](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_results.cfm?aid=8847776&icde=0). ![Puterman](http://profiles.ucsf.edu/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?NodeID=366241&cachekey=f6fb65f4-6b1b-46ea-9786-5997190f5f49)   
> [Telomere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere) is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromosome, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes.

He recommended two pop-books to get into the science of stress and ageing:

[Jan 19](https://github.com/andkov/about/blob/master/2016/log/jan/2016-01-19.md)  

1. advances in systematizing [current projects](https://github.com/andkov/about/blob/master/2016/log/jan/2016-01-19.md) in tables.   
2. presentation by [Eli Puterman](http://profiles.ucsf.edu/eli.puterman)    at the [COAG Colloquium Series](http://conferences.uvic.ca/index.php/coag/coagcs_spring2015). Add [link]() to the video lecture when it becomes available. Very engaging presentation on telemeres (see above) and ongoing research on the relationship between psychological stress and health outcomes, lead by [Elizabeth (Lisa) Blackburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Blackburn). Quite fascinating. High replay value.
3. met with @casslbrown to collect thoughts on the [wave inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion) project. [LOG issue](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/issues/3). We refreshed our memory on the current state of the project and found some concrete formulations for the next steps. We decided to start by giving a fresh look at our presentation last fall on the MAP data. In light of what has already [been done](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/blob/master/README.md), we'd like to start [finding words](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/issues/4) to answer the following question:    
*Would the conclusions drawn about cognitive change have been different, had we analysed the MAP data at different points in the lifespan of the study?* 
4. Spoke with @wibeasley regarding a [stencil](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil) he started for reconstructing [IALSA-2015-Portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland). I need to study the [issues]() and start organizing the work-flow. 


Jan 20 
 - spent the first half with @kmoselle, discussion VIHA projects. Here's the [log](https://github.com/IHACRU/VIHA-de-ID/issues/1)
 - in the afternoon, prepared the [presentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/documentation/LTDG/LTC_UVic_21_Jan_2016.html) on [grant completion](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/documentation/LTDG/LTC_UVic_21_Jan_2016.md) for the teaching grant from UVic's Learning and Teaching Centre

Jan 21
 - conference with @wibeasley and @maleeha about the [regex](https://github.com/wibeasley/regex-class-2015/issues/5) and [stencil](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues/12)  
 - [presented](https://github.com/andkov/psy532/blob/master/documentation/LTDG/LTC_UVic_21_Jan_2016.md) at LTC grant update session. 
  - we flipped the lecture, but not the lab (more funding?)  
  - scaffolding approach to teaching a particular   
  - ICRR become competitive with May 1 deadline  
  
[Jan 22, Friday](https://github.com/andkov/about/blob/master/2016/log/jan/2016-01-22.md)  

- attended UVic Psych Dept [colloquium](http://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/psychology/graduate/brain-sciences/cabssem/) talk by Morgan Teskey (@mteskey) on *Relating motor resonance and language: Not an open-and-shut case*. 
- Got a [fitbit Charge HR](https://www.fitbit.com/ca/chargehr) from Jonathan (@jru7sh) to explore the data pathways from collection to reporting. Loved the built and how it feels on the wrist. The iOS app for iPhone 6s works well.
- Drafted literature review for ongoing monitoring. Need to develop new reading habits to be engaged into the conversation.  
- Thought about how Data Curatorship fits into the CAR workshop model (see the daily log).

[Jan 25, Monday](https://github.com/andkov/about/blob/master/2016/log/jan/2016-01-25.md)
- spent the morning brushing up on the [portland-physical-cognitive track](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive).  
- updated the graph of the [cogntive domain map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/master/analysis/model_space/cog_domain_map/domain_map-1.png).
- was meant to meet with @ampiccinin, but the meeting did not occur. See the [log](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/4) of the project for this date.
