- Study Curator program is really a prequel to effective CAR workshops  
- Each study gets one curator, who is responsible for maintaining two repositories: private and public. 
- We need some symbolic language to describe the structural complexities of study coordinations

 - The role of Data Curator program is to shape the raw data material into groomed datasets, ready for analytical exercises.
