##  TODO 
for the week of Feb-01 to Feb-05
 
 1) new branch of Portland repo, cleaned for stencil ( project: [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland))  
 2) create a [dynamic table](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) for retrieving model estimates from output files. (advances two projects: [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland) and [portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive))   
 3) Read Coulombe et al. paper and start developing literature review for wave-inclusion paper   
 4) complete the transfer of the original MAP presentation and prepare to go over it with C.Brown, so that she may develop independent skills necessary to produce/maintain dynamic documents in this project   

## ToDo evaluation
1) not done. reformulated. instead of cleaning the entire stencil, our discussion on [2016-02-04](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues/15) suggested I focus on the `./reports` folder
2) not done. now this objective has been move in priority. We have to verify the accuracy of the parsing script before building the front end. THis, still will remain relevant, but can wait.
3) Done. Coulombe et al (2015) turned out to be a poor fit as a key paper. Focus has shifted to Rast and Hofer (2014) as Hertzog (2006, 2008) papers. See log : https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/issues/10
4) Almost done. The wave-inclusing repository has been shaped up very well and C.Brown got some scripting homework to go through.

## TECH SUPPORT

## [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)  
**description**: A script development. Developing reporting tools for coordinated analysis with replication (CAR) workshop, conducted in Portland on Feb 22-23, 2015.    
**progress**:  identified a new objective: solidify parsing scripts. Accuracy of result extraction must be made verifiable to isolate human processing errors and explore methodological reason for abberat numbers. see [log](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues/15)     
**roadblocks**: none    
**next steps**: create a Syntax Creator - a system for generating Mplus model scripts to be executed. The parser will reference this Syntax Creator, getting instructions on what to look for in the text output.

### [ialsa-2015-portland-stencil](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil)
**description**: Applying lessons from the Feb 2015 Portland workshop (and its repo) to a newer architecture.  Basically, we want to recreate Portland, but now to be ready for what is coming, so we can see whether the tool that we have developed can accommodate the complexity of the workshop.     
**progress**:  none. focusing on the parser right now. the [log](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues/15). 
**roadblocks**: The original Portland repo contains a lot of junk code, legacy of time-pressured development. These "junk" files block the stencil progress, requiring Maleeha to go through and annotate more files        
**next steps**: [issues](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues) for the full scope. tactical = create a branch of Portland repo that would retain only pieces that should be considered by the stencil.      
**notes**:  



## SCIENCE

## [ialsa-car-methods](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-car-methods)
**description**: A manuscript production. Paper on implementing the CAR methods pioneers in Portland.  
**progress**:  none    
**roadblocks**: more time       
**next steps**: re-draft the abstract, basic table of contents      
**notes**: 

### [portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive)
**description**:  A manuscript production. Focuses on the models from the [Portland CAR workshop](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)  in which *physical* and *cognitive* outcomes form a bivariate linear structure.     
**progress**:  none
**roadblocks**:  Andrea, I need your feedback: Some tactical decisions are still required: as the original taxonomy was revised during the last meeting with A.Piccinin, new domains have crystallized:  `perception` and `verbal reasoning`. They need to be incorporated into the continuum to finalize the current state of the graph.   See [issue #4](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/4). This of all things, justifies a meeting. WOuld be nice to review/verify this classification again.    
**next steps**:   create a [dynamic table](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) for retrieving model estimates from output files. This coincide with the tech support task for the Portland project.    
**notes**: 


### [wave-inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion)
**description**: How does the number of waves included into the analysis affect the conclusions from a longitudinal study?    
**progress**:  made advances on shaping up MAP data and its repo for Data Curator. Discussed literature. see [log](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/issues/10)
**roadblocks**: none apparent        
**next steps**: new paper in focus: Rast and Hofer (2014)
**notes**:
