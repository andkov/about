Notes during  [Deniz Erten-Lyons](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/neurology/alzheimers/faculty-staff/erten-lyons.cfm)  at the COAG colloquium 


Pathological underpinning of brain aging   

Brain weight declines on average by 2-3% per decade after age 50    
Beyond age 80 decliness by 10%    

25% of older people will die with brain looking like Alzheimer's, but they are really not.     

Research Question: What pathological changes correlate with structural changes in the brain?

[Oregon Alzhemer's Desease Center](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/neurology/alzheimers/about/adc/) (PI: [Jeffrey Kaye](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/neurology/alzheimers/kaye.cfm)  ~ 500 brains      

Oregon Brain Aging Study   
* 375 evaluated between 1989-2005  
* 305 enrolled   
* 193 died during follow up   
* 125 had autopsy  
* 74 participants, excluded 3%   
* 71 participants included into the study   
of them     
* 41/58% women   
* 44/62 cognitive impairment at death   


- we developed our own software REGION to compute brain volume, ventricular volume 

Q. What is the error of measurement of the ventricular volume? how accurate is this measurement? Why did you want to create your own software? 

white matter lesieons are very common in the aging brian, up to 90% prevalnce in people over 60 yo.


You may start a longitudinal study with cutting edge methods of measurement, but because of the rate of progress, as study progresses in time, those methods may become antiquated. This is especially relevant given the current rate of science developement.
