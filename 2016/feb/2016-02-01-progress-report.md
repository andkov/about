## TODO 
for the week of Feb-01 to Feb-05
 
 1) new branch of Portland repo, cleaned for stencil ( project: [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland))  
 2) create a [dynamic table](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) for retrieving model estimates from output files. (advances two projects: [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland) and [portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive))   
 3) Read Coulombe et al. paper and start developing literature review for wave-inclusion paper   
 4) complete the transfer of the original MAP presentation and prepare to go over it with C.Brown, so that she may develop independent skills necessary to produce/maintain dynamic documents in this project

## TECH SUPPORT

## [ialsa-2015-portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)  
**description**: A script development. Developing reporting tools for coordinated analysis with replication (CAR) workshop, conducted in Portland on Feb 22-23, 2015.    
**progress**:  none   
**roadblocks**: none    
**next steps**: strategic = complete engineering part of the project and move to the actual science. tactical = 1) create a [dynamic table](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) for retrieving model estimates from output files. The tools developed so far (see [reports](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/tree/master/reports))  appeared to be too bulky,  generating little interest from the modellers. 2) clean up the original Portland repo to ease Maleeha's job of stencil documentation.

### [ialsa-2015-portland-stencil](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil)

**description**: Applying lessons from the Feb 2015 Portland workshop (and its repo) to a newer architecture.  Basically, we want to recreate Portland, but now to be ready for what is coming, so we can see whether the tool that we have developed can accommodate the complexity of the workshop.     
**progress**:  none  
**roadblocks**: The original Portland repo contains a lot of junk code, legacy of time-pressured development. These "junk" files block the stencil progress, requiring Maleeha to go through and annotate more files        
**next steps**: [issues](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues) for the full scope. tactical = create a branch of Portland repo that would retain only pieces that should be considered by the stencil.      
**notes**:  



## SCIENCE


## [ialsa-car-methods](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-car-methods)
**description**: A manuscript production. Paper on implementing the CAR methods pioneers in Portland.  
**progress**:  none    
**roadblocks**: more time       
**next steps**: re-draft the abstract, basic table of contents      
**notes**: 

### [portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive)

**description**:  A manuscript production. Focuses on the models from the [Portland CAR workshop](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland)  in which *physical* and *cognitive* outcomes form a bivariate linear structure.     
**progress**:  updated the graph of the [cognitive domain map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/master/analysis/model_space/cog_domain_map/domain_map-1.png). The meeting with A.Piccinin did not occur, but I've created a [log entry](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/4) about what I wanted to discuss.          
**roadblocks**:  Some tactical decisions are still required: as the original taxonomy was revised during the last meeting with A.Piccinin, new domains have crystallized:  `perception` and `verbal reasoning`. They need to be incorporated into the continuum to finalize the current state of the graph.   See [issue #4](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/4).    
**next steps**:   create a [dynamic table](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland/issues/117) for retrieving model estimates from output files. This coincide with the tech support task for the Portland project.    
**notes**: this project is a manuscript production based upon [Portland](https://github.com/IALSA/IALSA-2015-Portland) script development. A lot of the progress will be capped by the tools we create for Portland workshop. I don't have a good sense of direction where/how this manuscript production should proceed, I spent most of my time fixing and writing scripts.   


### [wave-inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion)
**description**: How does the number of waves included into the analysis affect the conclusions from a longitudinal study?    
**progress**:  met with @casslbrown over google hangouts. here's the [log of the meeting](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/issues/8) with homework for each and next steps.       
**roadblocks**: none apparent        
**next steps**: focusing on the paper (Coulombe, P., Selig, J. P., & Delaney, H. D. (2015). Ignoring individual differences in times of assessment in growth curve modeling.) and getting some direction for the literature review. Next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, during which I will go over the mechanics of reproducing the reports and graphs to date. We also will discuss Coulombe paper.
