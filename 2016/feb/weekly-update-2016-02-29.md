  - 1. progress. met with C.Brown. [log](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP/issues/17). At this point, the data from the [MAP](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP) study is prepared for [ialsa-study-curator](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-study-curator) and can be used by others.     
  - 2. next steps. We don't have a record of how the data is obtained from the source. Such description should be added to the README. I created a separate [issue ](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP/issues/18) to track the discussion.

B. [wave-inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion)  
  - 1. progress. Met with G.Muniz and A.Robitaille ([log](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/issues/13)).  During the meeting we identified the focal objective at this moment: to demonstrate how statistical conclusion evolves with the maturation of the logitudinal study. Focus on using real data before designing a simulation that could attribute the effect to the features of the temporal design.   
 - 2. next steps. creating an information display for univeratite linear models, which would be the basis for demonstrate the problem facing modellers by the unfolding waves of longitudinal studies.
