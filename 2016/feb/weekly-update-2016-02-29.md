  - 1. progress. met with C.Brown. [log](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP/issues/17). At this point, the data from the [MAP](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP) study is prepared for [ialsa-study-curator](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-study-curator) and can be used by others.     
  - 2. next steps. We don't have a record of how the data is obtained from the source. Such description should be added to the README. I created a separate [issue ](https://github.com/IALSA/MAP/issues/18) to track the discussion.
