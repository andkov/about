B. [ialsa-2015-portland-stencil](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil)  
  1. progress. conceptualized the pipeline for the first REDCap survey: the Pre-conference survey. see [log](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues/21) for details.
  2. progress. debugged the syntax-creator. now it works. discussed with W.Beasley the naming rules for the flexible elements in the MPlus prototype, from which MPlus syntax will be generated using the R scripts we are developing.  
  3. next steps. play with syntax-creator script to understand how to optimize it.    
  4. next steps. be ready to test-drive the PCS to offer the feedback during the next meeting.   
  
C. [ialsa-study-curator](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-study-curator)   
  1. progress. Went through folder structure of MAP and LASA to see the similarities. From these two instances I have abstracted a [template](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-study-curator/tree/new-study-template) for adding new longitudinal studies to the curatorship project. This template would have to be modified as new studies are added, but it's a start.    
  2. progress.  Shaped up [HRS](https://github.com/IALSA/HRS) for Study curatorship. Cleaned .gitignore. started a new architecture in order to fit into the current template.  
  3. next steps. Go over the scripts that prepare HRS data, edit, optimize, and documente them,  creating a `reproduce.R` script that would automate the data creation from the raw files.

C. [portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive)   
  1. progress. Clarified the role of the domain map as the privary information display in the course of PCS (pre-conference survey). This map will be solidified as much as possible during the PCS. see [log](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-2015-portland-stencil/issues/21) for details.
