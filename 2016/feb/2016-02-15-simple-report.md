SCIENCE   
 
A. [ialsa-car-methods](https://github.com/IALSA/ialsa-car-methods)    
 1. progress. Recent meeting with W.Beasley helped clarify the data flow, although the language of expressing these concepts remains murky.  I'm sketching the diagrams, but don't see anything I like yet.  
 2. next steps. Must start sketching a diagram of the work flow.
 
 
B. [wave-inclusion](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion)     
 1. progress. Met with C.Brown and shared the first impressions from [rast-hofer-2014](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/tree/master/literature/rast-hofer-2014).    
 2. next steps. C.Brown and myself need to spend some time reading. I've skim-read [rast-hofer-2014](https://github.com/IALSA/wave-inclusion/tree/master/literature/rast-hofer-2014) paper and it should be the place of our departure. However, a much closer examination of the paper is required before I can pick up the conversation where Rast and Hofer take off. Meeting scheduled with C.Brown for Feb, 16.   
 
 
C. [portland-physical-cognitive](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive) 1. roadblock. Need some feedback from A. Piccinin (see [issue #4](https://github.com/IALSA/Portland-physical-cognitive/issues/4).
