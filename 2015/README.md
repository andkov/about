chronicles of 2015

* January:April    
 - Adapting Lesa Hoffman's book on Longitudinal Modeling to the curriculum of PSYC-564 at University of Victoria. I have created a [repository][psy564] containing the scripts applying the models from some of the chapters.  Repositories: [psy564]()

 ### Data Curators project

 To facilitate replication across studies, the IALSA research network supported my initiative to launched the [Data Curator](https://github.com/IALSA/Data-Curator) project, which organizes the preparation of data sets for analysis from selected longitudinal studies of the network. Each longitudinal study selected from the IALSA network for analysis has a team managing its shaping, which is an ongoing process, as studies add rounds of data and researchers generate demand for targeted appropriation of data for analysis.
 
It is frequently impractical to shape the entire body of the data for analysis from a particular study before any analyses can be conducted. Instead, researchers limit their scope to the subset of data that aligns with their research agenda. The architecture of repositories in the Data Curator project has been built to anticipate **incremental appropriation** of the data for analysis: one team member will contribute only a few items to the skeleton of the appropriated dataset. 
Researchers in the management team for the corresponding study will provide their expert knowledge of the selected variables,  crowd-sourcing the scrupulosity of data preparation. 
 
You can think of this as recreating the puzzle from small pieces. We start with the box containing all the pieces. But they are not in the form conducive to understanding what is depicted on it. So we start putting it together. One person can't do it, but ever next research puts in another piece (relevant to HIS research agenda), thus advancing data appropriation.
